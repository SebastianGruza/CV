---

## üéØ Problem Statement

**Classic TSP Challenge**:
The Traveling Salesman Problem is NP-hard - finding optimal solutions for large instances (1000+ cities) is computationally prohibitive.

**Innovative Solution**:
GPU-accelerated Genetic Algorithm with advanced optimization techniques:
- **GPU Parallelization**: Aparapi framework (Java ‚Üí GPU kernels)
- **Advanced GA Operators**: Multiple mutation/crossover strategies
- **Novel Population Management**: Colony-based evolution with adaptive merging
- **Tabu Search Integration**: Escape local minima
- **Real-time Visualization**: Spring Boot web interface

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Spring Framework (Spring Boot)
- **GPU Acceleration**: Aparapi (Java ‚Üí OpenCL/GPU)
- **Algorithms**: Genetic Algorithms, Tabu Search, 2-Opt, 3-Opt heuristics
- **Visualization**: Real-time web UI (http://127.0.0.1:8080)

### Architecture Highlights
- **Custom GPU Kernel**: TspGAKernel - GA operations directly on GPU
- **Configuration-Driven**: application.properties for tuning
- **Scalable**: Handles 1 to 10,000+ cities

---

## üöÄ Key Innovations

### 1. GPU Acceleration (Aparapi)
**Why it matters**:
- **Massive Parallelism**: 512+ GPU threads vs. CPU threads
- **Performance**: ~10-100x faster than CPU-only implementations
- **Custom Kernel**: Direct GPU programming in Java (rare skill!)

**Implementation**:
```java
// Custom pseudo-random number generator (XORShift) for GPU
// Thread-local storage to avoid shared state
// Preallocated data structures (no dynamic allocation on GPU)
```

### 2. Advanced Genetic Operators

**7 Different Mutation Strategies**:
1. **Segment Relocation** - moves route segments
2. **Three Vertices Relocation** - relocates 3 cities simultaneously
3. **Two Vertices Relocation** - relocates 2 cities
4. **Single Vertex Relocation** - moves 1 city
5. **Vertex Swap** - swaps two cities
6. **2-Opt Heuristic** - reverses segments (eliminates crossings)
7. **3-Opt Heuristic** - reconnects 3 segments optimally

**Adaptive Selection**: Mutation strategy chosen dynamically based on problem size and population state

### 3. Colony-Based Evolution

**Novel Approach**:
- Population divided into multiple **colonies** (configurable via `tsp.colonyMultiplier`)
- Each colony evolves **independently** ‚Üí diversity preservation
- **Adaptive Colony Merging** at predefined time points (e.g., 40%, 65%, 82%, 95% of total time)
  - Shares genetic material between colonies
  - Prevents premature convergence
  - Injects diversity at critical moments

**Why it works**:
- Balances **exploration** (independent colonies) and **exploitation** (merging best solutions)
- Similar to island models in parallel GA, but optimized for GPU

### 4. Tabu Search Integration

**Mechanism**:
- **Tabu List**: Binary Search Tree (BST) on GPU
- Penalizes recently explored paths
- Forces algorithm to escape local minima
- GPU-optimized BST implementation (non-trivial!)

### 5. Custom PRNG for GPU

**Challenge**: Standard Java Random not GPU-compatible
**Solution**: XORShift-based PRNG
- Thread-safe (each GPU thread has own state)
- Fast and statistically robust
- Prevents correlation between threads

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: "Why Aparapi instead of CUDA/OpenCL directly?"**
A: Aparapi allows Java developers to write GPU code without leaving the JVM. Since the project uses Spring Framework, keeping everything in Java simplifies deployment and integration. For more control, I'd consider CUDA, but Aparapi was the right balance for this project.

**Q: "How does colony merging improve results?"**
A: Independent colonies explore different regions of the solution space. Merging at strategic times (40%, 65%, etc.) allows genetic material sharing while preserving diversity early on. This prevents premature convergence while still leveraging best solutions.

**Q: "What's the time complexity?"**
A: Per generation: O(population_size √ó n¬≤) for fitness evaluation (where n = cities). GPU parallelism reduces wall-clock time by ~100x. Total generations depend on problem size and convergence criteria.

**Q: "Could this scale to 100K cities?"**
A: Memory would be the bottleneck (n¬≤ distance matrix). Solutions: sparse matrix representation, chunking, or switching to approximate algorithms (Lin-Kernighan). GPU memory limits would require multi-GPU or distributed approach.
